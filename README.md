# ANTI-PATTERN-DETECTION




ANTI-PATTERN-DETECTION Repository
Welcome to the ANTI-PATTERN-DETECTION repository!

About
This repository contains a Python tool for detecting anti-patterns in code. Anti-patterns are common solutions to problems that are ineffective or counterproductive. This tool uses static code analysis to identify potential anti-patterns in Python code.

Features
Detects God Objects: classes with too many responsibilities or methods
Detects Long Methods: methods that are too long or complex
Detects Switch Statements with Many Cases: switch statements with too many cases
Detects Duplicate Code: duplicate code blocks or methods
Usage
Install the tool using pip: pip install anti-pattern-detection
Run the tool on your code using the command: anti-pattern-detection your_code.py
The tool will output a list of detected anti-patterns.

Related Programming Techniques
This project uses a variety of programming techniques to analyze and improve the quality of code. Here are some of the key techniques used:

Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Parsing
AST Traversal: Walking through an abstract syntax tree to analyze or transform code.
Node Visitors: Implementing a visitor pattern to traverse an AST and perform actions on specific node types.
Syntax Analysis: Analyzing the syntax of code to detect errors, warnings, or anti-patterns.
Parser Generators: Using tools like ANTLR or yacc to generate parsers for specific programming languages.
Code Analysis and Refactoring
Static Code Analysis: Analyzing code without executing it to detect errors, warnings, and anti-patterns.
Code Smells Detection: Identifying code smells, such as god objects, long methods, and switch statements with many cases.
Refactoring: Improving the internal structure and organization of code without changing its external behavior.
Code Metrics Analysis: Measuring code quality using metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, Halstead complexity, and maintainability index.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Design Patterns
Class and Object Design: Designing classes and objects to represent real-world entities and concepts.
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Ensuring that a class or module has only one reason to change.
God Object Anti-Pattern: Identifying and refactoring classes that have too many responsibilities or methods.
Design Patterns: Using patterns like Singleton, Factory, or Observer to solve common design problems.
Python-Specific Techniques
AST Module: Using Python's built-in ast module to parse and analyze Python code.
NodeVisitor Class: Implementing a custom NodeVisitor class to traverse an AST and perform actions on specific node types.
Python Code Analysis: Analyzing Python code to detect errors, warnings, or anti-patterns.
Python Refactoring: Improving the internal structure and organization of Python code without changing its external behavior.
